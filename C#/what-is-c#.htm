What is C#?
What would you like to build? If you can name it, you can probably build it with C#.

This programming language can be used to make interactive websites, mobile apps, video games, 
augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), desktop applications, and back-end services â€“ 
just to name a few. For example, the mobile game Pokemon Go and the Stack Overflow website 
were built with frameworks that can be run with C# (Unity and ASP.NET, respectively).
