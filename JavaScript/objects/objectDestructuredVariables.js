/*
However, we can also take advantage of a destructuring technique called destructured assignment to save ourselves some keystrokes. In destructured assignment we create a variable with the name of an objectâ€™s key that is wrapped in curly braces { } and assign to it the object. Take a look at the example below:
*/

const robot = {
  model: '1E78V2',
  energyLevel: 100,
  functionality: {
    beep() {
      console.log('Beep Boop');
    },
    fireLaser() {
      console.log('Pew Pew');
    },
  }
};

const { functionality } = robot;

functionality.beep();
